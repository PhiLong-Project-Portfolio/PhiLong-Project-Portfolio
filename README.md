ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Phi Long and here is my project portfolio.

My journey in data analytics is driven by a simple belief: "The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight". 

This portfolio reflects my pursuit of a career as a Data Analyst. In this portfolio, I showcase my approach to data analysis, where I combine technical skills with a creative mindset to deliver meaningful insights. Each project is an opportunity to turn data into actionable insights that lead to success.
